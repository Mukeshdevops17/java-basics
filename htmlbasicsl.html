attributes

All HTML elements can have attributes.
Attributes provide additional information about elements.
Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. Ex:
    <a href="https://www.abc.com">Visit Link</a>
    The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed: Ex. <img src="img.jpg">
    The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specifies the width and height of the image (in pixels).
     Ex: <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">
    The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more. Ex:
    <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
    The title attribute defines some extra information about an element. The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element. Ex. <p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
    Note: The HTML standard does not require quotes around attribute values. However, W3C recommends quotes in HTML. Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.
